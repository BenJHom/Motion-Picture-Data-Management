# Motion-Picture-Data-Management
Mayvue Technical Project:

To create the tables, open the SQL script in MSSMS or another SQL database management software and run the script.  It will create the table and populate it with a few motion pictures.

In order to run the application, open the VS solution and run the server.  This starts the model/controller.  Access to the database is dependent on windows authentication.

Then enter the 'vue' directory in this repository and enter into a CLI 'npm run serve'.  If done correctly, a table with 'Motion Pictures' as its header and a populated table will be present.  'motion-picture-vue' is NOT a functioning front-end, it was installed using the wrong package manager.  Please open the directory simply titled 'vue', otherwise the project will not work.

Thank you.
